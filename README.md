# Christmas-Pal-Script
Pal Script (for Sam Broadcaster) to enhance station playback of Christmas music

# Setup
The Christmas1.pal screen needs to be scheduled in the Event Scheduler

I believe the Pal script needs to be in the "Pal Script" listing, but stopped, then invoked via the scheduler

In my use case, I have it set at 20 minute intervals to run.

One thing I was trying to achieve with this script, was a graded, as we get closer to Christmas, approach to the density of Christmas content. I wanted to maintain the original flavor of the station, but overlay the Christmas content gradually, increasing as we approached Christmas, and then fading out after Christmas.

You'll see in the script by the days, as we get closer, the number of tracks is simply increased as the schedule runs. There's also a "Quiet" category for more easy listening Christmas, to intersperse varied feel, during evenings. And the reverse after Christmas as we ease out.
