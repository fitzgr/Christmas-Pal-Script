# Christmas-Pal-Script
Pal Script (for Sam Broadcaster) to enhance station playback of Christmas music

# Setup
The Christmas1.pal screen needs to be scheduled in the Event Scheduler

I believe the Pal script needs to be in the "Pal Script" listing, but stopped, then invoked via the scheduler

In my use case, I have it set at 20 minute intervals to run.
